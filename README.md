# NodeMCU Arduino client skeleton sketches
Arduino client sketches for NodeMCU-32S boards

Release: 4.0 compatible

These sketches are currently only running in insecure mode (plain HTTP). 
Secure mode will be added later. 

To use the sketches, use [Espressif ESP-32 development boards](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32), and replace the boards.txt and default.bin files according to the readme within the sketch folders.
